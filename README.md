## Resume ##
As a Computer Science senior at the Federal University of Espírito Santo, I have been exploring the impact of Artificial Intelligence and advanced machine learning techniques, which are the focus of my undergraduate thesis. I am also passionate about Information Security and how it can be integrated into the development of efficient and secure systems.

With practical experience in Python, I implement AI solutions in both academic projects and my thesis. Additionally, I work with Java and PL/SQL, developing web applications that emphasize performance and security. Throughout my academic journey, I have been involved in projects and courses that allowed me to work with languages such as PHP and JavaScript, further honing my skills in web development, automation, and problem-solving.

My professional experience includes two years of developing automated reports using JasperSoft Report, integrated with ORACLE PL/SQL databases. I am constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my skills, collaborate with innovative teams, and contribute to impactful projects in the tech world.
